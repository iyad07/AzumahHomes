# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues with SubmitListingPage After Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables
✅ **Status**: Environment variables are properly configured in `.env`
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL: Configured
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Configured

**For Production Deployment:**
- Ensure these environment variables are added to your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- Variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the browser

### 2. Database Connection Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Form submission fails
- Loading states hang
- "Database connection not available" errors

**Solutions:**
- Verify Supabase project is active and not paused
- Check database URL is accessible from production environment
- Ensure RLS (Row Level Security) policies are properly configured

### 3. Authentication Issues
**Symptoms:**
- User authentication fails
- "You must be logged in" errors
- Redirect loops

**Solutions:**
- Verify Supabase Auth is properly configured
- Check site URL in Supabase Auth settings matches production URL
- Ensure redirect URLs are whitelisted in Supabase

### 4. Form Validation Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Form doesn't submit
- Validation errors persist
- Fields reset unexpectedly

**Solutions:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all required fields are properly filled
- Ensure form schema validation is working

### 5. Build/Bundle Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Page loads but functionality is broken
- Missing imports or components
- TypeScript errors in production

**Solutions:**
- Run `npm run build` locally to check for build errors
- Verify all imports are correct and files exist
- Check for case-sensitive file path issues

### 6. Network/CORS Issues
**Symptoms:**
- API calls fail with CORS errors
- Network timeouts
- 403/401 errors

**Solutions:**
- Verify Supabase project allows requests from production domain
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure API keys have proper permissions

## Debugging Steps

   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for JavaScript errors in Console tab
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

2. **Verify Environment:**
   - Ensure production environment variables are set
   - Test database connection manually

3. **Test Locally:**
   - Run `npm run build && npm run preview` to test production build locally
   - Compare behavior between development and production builds

4. **Check Deployment Logs:**
   - Review build logs for errors
   - Check runtime logs for issues
